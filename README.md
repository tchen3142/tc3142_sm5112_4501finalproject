#### Introduction
For this project, we conducted data analysis on a dataset consisting of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services. Each call to 311 has a number of datapoints tracked and aggregated. There are approximately 2,587,316 cases with 41 features that include Unique Key, Incident Zip, Created Date, and Closed Date. We explored the following questions below for our analysis. 

#### - Question 1
In the Jupyter notebook Top10.ipynb, we analyzed the top 10 casuses of calls to 311 in our chosen area under ZIP code 10016 in the year 2020, and counted the amount of incidents to the identified types. The variable "top 10" shows the resulted answers in descending order by the number of incidents. 
The top 10 types of incidents with the corresponding amount are as followed: 
Noise - Helicopter with 2530 cases; Noise - Residential with 1340 cases; Noise with 969 cases; Illegal Parking with 963 cases; Homeless Person Assistance with 701 cases; Non-Emergency Police Matter with 604 cases; HEAT/HOT WATER with 582 cases; Street Condition with 563 cases; NonCompliance with Phased Reopening with 560 cases; and Homeless Street Condition with 445 cases.

#### - Question 2
In the Jupyter notebook Parking.ipynb, we analyzed which area under ZIP code 10016 has a higher rate of illegal parking incidents over total 311 incidents than the general illegal parking incident rate. The variable "higher_parking_proportion" shows an answer of False, which indicates that the area under ZIP code 10016 does not have higher rate of illegal parking incident over total 311 incidents.

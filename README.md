#### __Question 1__
##### In the Jupyter notebook Top10.ipynb, we analyzed the top 10 casuses of calls to 311 in our chosen area under ZIP code 10016 in the year 2020, and counted the amount of incidents to the identified types. The variable "top 10" shows the resulted answers in descedning order by number of incidents. The top 10 types of incidents with the corresponding amount are as followed: Noise - Helicopter with 2530 cases; Noise - Residential with 1340 cases; Noise with 969 cases; Illegal Parking with 963 cases; Homeless Person Assistance with 701 cases; Non-Emergency Police Matter with 604 cases; HEAT/HOT WATER with 582 cases; Street Condition with 563 cases; NonCompliance with Phased Reopening with 560 cases; and Homeless Street Condition with 445 cases. 

#### __Question 2__ 
##### In the Jupyter notebook Parking.ipynb, we analyzed whether area under ZIP code 10016 has a higher rate of illegal parking incidents over total 311 incidents than the general illegal parking incident rate. The variable "higher_parking_proportion" shows an answer of False, which indicates that area under ZIP code 10016 does not have higher rate of illegal parking incident over total 311 incidents.
